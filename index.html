  <div class="box3">
    In the first stage, the ground water is ozonized to destroy the virus and bacteria. The next step involves purification by sand filter which removes coarse particles up to 30 microns in size. A carbon filter is then used to remove color and odor, followed by Reverse Osmosis to filter harmful minerals and salts. The following step involves fortification of water with minerals. Finally the water is ozonized once more to ensure zero-contamination during packaging and storing. Bisleri with added minerals is available in 250 ml, 500 ml, 1 litre and 2 litre bottles and 5 litre, 15 litre and 20 litre jars.
